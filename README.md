# pulselinestudio
an immersive Three.js command center where staffing, queue pressure, and live production health pulse alive. Run scenarios through a Flask-powered simulator, watch the conveyor belt, backlog cubes, and beam effects respond in real time, and navigate the map. Adjust the control panel as you dial in arrival rates, belt speed, and assistant counts.
